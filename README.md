# aerial_object_track
This research project is for detect and track the suspicious object in aerial using cascade classifier models.

Couple of models were developed (Haar and LBP), which assist to detect and track aircraft in ground point of perspective.

Datasets were provided in each model folder with developed models.

In addition, sample videos were provided for testing pursuit with working python code.

This research project is published in 'SPIE Sensors+Imaging'.

Title of this research: Detecting and tracking the position of suspicious objects using vision system.
